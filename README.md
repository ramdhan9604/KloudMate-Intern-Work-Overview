## ðŸ”§ Work Summary

### 1. Initial Documentation Work

#### OpenTelemetry Collector Documentation
- Explored and understood the setup guide, configuration examples, and troubleshooting section of the OpenTelemetry Collector.
- **Definition:** OpenTelemetry Collector is a vendor-agnostic service for receiving, processing, and exporting telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. It helps in standardizing observability pipelines across services.
- [OpenTelemetry Docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/)
- [OpenTelemetry GitHub](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io)

#### KloudMate Documentation
- Reviewed the onboarding guide, integration instructions, and various use-case examples to understand how KloudMate integrates with observability tools.
- **Definition:** KloudMate is a developer-centric observability platform offering real-time insights into distributed systems, enabling proactive monitoring and alerting.
- [KloudMate Docs](https://docs.kloudmate.com/)
- [Server Metrics Integration](https://docs.kloudmate.com/server-metrics-to-kloudmate-with-host-metrics-receiver)

### 2. Architecture: AI-Powered Anomaly Detection

#### Understanding of the System Architecture
- Gained hands-on experience with the architecture and flow of the AI-powered anomaly detection system, including a detailed flowchart of the LLM integration.  
  [Architecture Flow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aNXZo8MI6slwBP3ApsuuxQ9D-_g83pkD/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Key Architectural Components
- **Data Ingestion:** Captures and collects time-series metrics, logs, and traces.
- **Component Discovery & Knowledge Graph Builder:** Builds a graph-based representation of service relationships and dependencies.
- **Context Enrichment & Embedding Layer:** Enhances incoming data with contextual metadata and vectorizes it for downstream analysis.
- **Anomaly Detection & Pattern Learner:** Uses statistical and ML-based models to identify anomalies and learn recurring patterns.
- **Context-Aware Analysis Engine:** Performs correlation and root cause evaluation with full context awareness.
- **Smart Prompting:** Leverages LLM-based techniques to generate human-understandable explanations.
- **Tenant Customization:** Allows per-tenant rules, configurations, and threshold settings.
- **Explainable AI:** Ensures model outputs are interpretable and transparent for end users.
- **Modular Implementation:** Designed as plug-and-play modules for scalability and maintainability.

### 3. Time-Series Models & Feature Enhancements

#### Models Evaluated
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):**
  - A popular time-series forecasting model that combines autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) components to model temporal dependencies and trends.

- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA):**
  - An extension of ARIMA that supports modeling seasonality by adding seasonal components to the ARIMA framework.

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks):**
  - A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data. Highly effective for time-series forecasting due to its memory cell structure.

- [ARIMA vs SARIMA vs LSTM - Detailed Comparison](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nAcJfakGkUiEl5kq0heTe8zvhUC48Y58Aq92iUoCxMo/edit?tab=t.0)

#### Also Tested
- **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**
  - A type of moving average that gives more weight to recent observations, making it more responsive to new data compared to simple moving averages.

- **STL Decomposition (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess):**
  - A robust technique that decomposes time-series data into seasonal, trend, and residual components using locally weighted regression (LOESS).

#### Feature Enhancements
- Implemented a **Confidence Score** in the anomaly results table to validate the reliability of detected anomalies.
- This addition helped in **quantifying the certainty of model outputs**, aiding business decision-making.

### 4. NLP / LLM Components

- Developed **root-cause explanation module** using pre-trained LLMs (e.g., from Hugging Face).
- Integrated **prompt-engineering pipeline:**  
  Input anomaly context â†’ formatted prompt â†’ error-cause output.
- Demonstrated ability to deliver **human-readable, contextual explanations** for alerts.

### 5. Tools and Platforms

#### Grafana
- Used for creating dashboards and visualizing telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces).
- [Grafana Docs](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/07/02/identify-anomalies-outlier-detection-forecasting-how-grafana-cloud-uses-ai-ml-to-make-observability-easier/)

#### Datadog
- Integrated and explored Datadog for full-stack observability and alerting systems.
- [Datadog Docs](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/introducing-anomaly-detection-datadog/)

- Additional Resource:  
  [Grafana Cloud Visualization](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGoDOaPt8I/xaz4ivCBiiqQEMnJLLEnKA/view?utm_content=DAGoDOaPt8I&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h200c8bd1f6)
